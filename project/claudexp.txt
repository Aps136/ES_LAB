The system will:

Detect which player pressed their buzzer first
Allow the moderator to judge answers using a keypad
Update and display scores on an LCD
Use LEDs to indicate which player is currently answering

Let me develop a complete solution for this project.
System Overview
This quiz buzzer system implements the requirements you specified:

Player Interaction:

Two players can press their buzzers to respond to questions
The system detects which player pressed first
LEDs indicate which player is currently answering


Moderator Control:

Moderator uses keypad to judge answers (A = correct, B = wrong, C = reset)
If first player answers incorrectly, second player gets a chance


Scoring:

Scores update after correct answers
Scores display on LCD in descending order
Current game state is shown on the bottom line of LCD
Hardware Connections

Player Buzzers: P2.0 (Player 1) and P2.1 (Player 2)
Player LEDs: P2.2 (Player 1) and P2.3 (Player 2)
Sound Buzzer: P2.4
LCD: Using the same connections from your sample code
Keypad: Same row/column configuration as your sample code

How The System Works

When a question is asked, the system waits for a player to press their buzzer
First player to press gets the LED lit and "Player X First!" displayed
Moderator judges the answer:

Press 'A' if correct (updates score)
Press 'B' if wrong (switches to second player if available)
Press 'C' to reset the system


Scores are continuously displayed in descending order
If both players answer incorrectly, the system resets

Debouncing for reliable button detection
